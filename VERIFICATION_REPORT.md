## ⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. API Endpoints (Non-Critical)
**Issue**: Authentication endpoints not implemented  
**Impact**: User login/registration features unavailable  
**Resolution**: Implement auth routes in `/server/routes/`

### 2. Frontend Build (Non-Critical)
**Issue**: Build artifacts not generated  
**Impact**: Production deployment requires build step  
**Resolution**: Run `npm run build` when needed

### 3. Security Features (Low Priority)
**Issue**: Some security headers and rate limiting not configured  
**Impact**: Production deployment would benefit from hardening  
**Resolution**: Add security middleware for production
