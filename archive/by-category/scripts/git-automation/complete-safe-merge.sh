🎯 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:

1. SIDEBAR OVERLAP RISK - ELIMINATED
   - Removed EnhancedSidebar from all page components
   - Consolidated to single ModernSidebar in main layout
   - Fixed visual overlap and UI conflicts
   - Maintained RTL support and proper navigation

2. TYPESCRIPT COMPILATION ERRORS - RESOLVED
   - Fixed 17 compilation errors in training.ts
   - Corrected property naming (createdAt -> created_at, datasetId -> dataset_id)
   - Fixed return type issues and generic type arguments
   - Ensured type safety and interface compliance

3. VITE BUILD CONFIGURATION - FIXED
   - Updated build script to use cross-env NODE_ENV=production
   - Resolved production build failures
   - Enabled proper environment variable handling

4. ES MODULE COMPATIBILITY - RESTORED
   - Converted require() statements to import statements
   - Fixed file extension imports (.js)
   - Resolved module system conflicts
   - Updated connection-pool.js to ES modules

📊 IMPACT:
- Build Status: FAILED → ✅ SUCCESS
- TypeScript: FAIL → ✅ PASS
- Sidebar Risk: HIGH → ✅ LOW
- ES Modules: ERROR → ✅ COMPATIBLE
