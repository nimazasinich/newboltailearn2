# Example Usage of replace_branch_with_main.sh

## Basic Usage
```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already done)
chmod +x replace_branch_with_main.sh

# Replace a branch with main contents
./replace_branch_with_main.sh backup/ci-fixes-2025-09-16

# Or with any other branch name
./replace_branch_with_main.sh feature/old-implementation
./replace_branch_with_main.sh hotfix/emergency-fix
```

## What the script does:
1. ✅ Creates a backup tag before any destructive actions
2. ✅ Validates git repository and branch existence  
3. ✅ Updates main to latest from remote
4. ✅ Switches to target branch
5. ✅ Resets target branch to match main exactly
6. ✅ Force pushes to remote (with user confirmation)
7. ✅ Provides verification and rollback instructions

## Safety Features:
- 🛡️ Requires explicit "yes" confirmation before destructive actions
- 🛡️ Creates backup tags with timestamps
- 🛡️ Validates git repository and branch existence
- 🛡️ Clear error messages and colored output
- 🛡️ Provides rollback instructions in output

## Rollback if needed:
If you need to restore the original branch:
```bash
git checkout <TARGET_BRANCH>
git reset --hard <BACKUP_TAG_NAME>
git push origin <TARGET_BRANCH> --force
```

The backup tag name will be shown in the script output.
