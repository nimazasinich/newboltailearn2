# Persian Legal AI - Frontend and Beacon Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend Not Loading (Empty Page)
**Problem**: The frontend was showing nothing because it wasn't being served properly.

**Root Cause**: 
- The server was only serving API endpoints
- No static file serving for the built frontend
- No SPA fallback for client-side routing

**Solution**:
- Added static file serving for the `/docs` directory (built frontend)
- Added SPA fallback route (`app.get('*')`) to serve `index.html` for all non-API routes
- Updated server to serve everything from port 8080

### 2. Beacon Service Not Running
**Problem**: User mentioned "beacons" weren't running properly.

**Root Cause**: 
- No monitoring/health check endpoints beyond basic `/health`
- No real-time system metrics
- Missing beacon-like functionality for system monitoring

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint with comprehensive system metrics
- Added `/api/system/metrics` endpoint for real-time monitoring
- Added "beacon" status indicators in API responses
- Implemented memory, CPU, and uptime monitoring

### 3. Port Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Inconsistent port configuration between Docker logs (8080) and actual configuration (8000).

**Root Cause**:
- Docker configuration was set to port 8000
- Server default was port 8000
- But logs showed port 8080

**Solution**:
- Standardized everything to port 8080
- Updated Docker configuration
- Updated server default port
- Updated health check endpoints

## Technical Changes Made

### Server Changes (`/workspace/server/index.js`)
```javascript
// Added static file serving
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../docs')));

// Enhanced health endpoint with beacon functionality
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
    // Returns comprehensive system metrics including beacon status
});

// Added system metrics endpoint
app.get('/api/system/metrics', (req, res) => {
    // Returns real-time system metrics for monitoring page
});

// Added SPA fallback
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../docs/index.html'));
});

// Changed default port to 8080
const port = process.env.SERVER_PORT || 8080;
```

### API Service Updates (`/workspace/src/services/api.ts`)
```typescript
// Updated endpoint paths to match server implementation
monitoring: (): Promise<SystemMetrics> => requestWithSchema('/system/metrics', SystemMetricsSchema),
systemStats: (): Promise<SystemMetrics> => requestWithSchema('/system/metrics', SystemMetricsSchema),
getSystemMetrics: (): Promise<SystemMetrics> => requestWithSchema('/system/metrics', SystemMetricsSchema),
```

### Docker Configuration Updates
- **Dockerfile**: Changed exposed port from 8000 to 8080
- **docker-compose.yml**: 
  - Updated backend port mapping to 8080:8080
  - Removed separate frontend service (now served by backend)
  - Updated health check URL to use port 8080

### Frontend Build
- Rebuilt the frontend with latest changes
- Updated API endpoints to match server implementation

## Current Status

✅ **Frontend Loading**: The Persian Legal AI Dashboard now loads properly  
✅ **Beacon Service**: Health monitoring and system metrics are active  
✅ **Port Consistency**: All services now use port 8080  
✅ **API Connectivity**: Frontend can communicate with backend APIs  
✅ **Monitoring Page**: Real-time system metrics display working  

## Testing Results

1. **Health Endpoint**: `curl http://localhost:8080/health` returns comprehensive system status with beacon info
2. **Frontend**: `curl http://localhost:8080/` serves the React application properly
3. **System Metrics**: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/system/metrics` returns real-time monitoring data
4. **SPA Routing**: All frontend routes work correctly with fallback

## Next Steps

The container should now work properly with:
- Frontend accessible at `http://localhost:8080`
- Health/beacon monitoring at `http://localhost:8080/health`
- System metrics at `http://localhost:8080/api/system/metrics`
- All monitoring features active in the dashboard

To deploy, rebuild the Docker container and it should resolve both the empty frontend and missing beacon functionality issues.
