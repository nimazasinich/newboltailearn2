# Persian Legal AI Server - Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing `system_logs` Table Issue

**Problem**: Server was failing with error `"Could not log to database: no such table: system_logs"`

**Root Cause**: The simple server in `server/index.js` was using `DatabaseManager` but not applying the database schema that includes the `system_logs` table.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `server/database/DatabaseManager.js` to automatically apply the database schema on initialization
- Added `applySchema()` method that reads and executes `server/database/schema.sql`
- Added proper error handling and verification that `system_logs` table is created

**Files Modified**:
- `/workspace/server/database/DatabaseManager.js`

**Verification**: Server now starts without the "no such table" error and successfully creates the `system_logs` table.

### 2. ✅ Docker Configuration Port Mismatch

**Problem**: Server was receiving frequent SIGTERM signals and restarting due to port configuration mismatches in Docker setup.

**Root Cause**: 
- `docker-compose.yml` was mapping host port 8000 to container port 3000
- Environment variables were inconsistent (SERVER_PORT=3000, but Dockerfile exposed port 8000)
- Health check was trying to access wrong port

**Solutions Applied**:

#### A. Fixed Port Mapping in docker-compose.yml
```yaml
# Before
ports:
  - "8000:3000"
environment:
  - SERVER_PORT=3000
  - PORT=3000

# After  
ports:
  - "8000:8000"
environment:
  - SERVER_PORT=8000
  - PORT=8000
```

#### B. Fixed Health Check Port
```yaml
# Before
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-fsS", "http://localhost:3000/health"]

# After
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-fsS", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
```

#### C. Created Proper Multi-Stage Dockerfile
- Added multi-stage build with `backend` and `frontend` targets
- Ensured consistent port configuration (8000) across all stages

**Files Modified**:
- `/workspace/docker-compose.yml`
- `/workspace/Dockerfile`

---

### 3. ✅ Frontend Build Configuration

**Problem**: Docker frontend stage was trying to copy from non-existent `dist/` directory.

**Solution Applied**:
- Built frontend assets using `npm run build` (creates `docs/` directory)
- Updated Dockerfile to copy from `docs/` instead of `dist/`

**Files Modified**:
- `/workspace/Dockerfile`

2025-09-22 03:39:34.179 | Received SIGTERM, closing database...
```

### After Fixes
```

✅ system_logs table created successfully
Database initialized successfully
Database test successful: { test: 1 }
Persian Legal AI Server running on port 8000
```

### Health Check Verification
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/health
{"status":"ok","database":"connected","timestamp":"2025-09-22T00:19:21.336Z"}
```

## Configuration Summary

### Current Working Configuration
- **Server Port**: 8000 (consistent across all configurations)
- **Database Path**: `/app/data/database.sqlite` (in Docker) or `./data/database.sqlite` (local)
- **Schema**: Automatically applied on database initialization
- **Health Check**: Available at `/health` endpoint
- **Frontend**: Built assets in `docs/` directory served via nginx

### Environment Variables (Production)
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/database.sqlite
SERVER_PORT=8000
PORT=8000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Test Docker Compose Build**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Verify Services**:
   - Backend health: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
   - Frontend access: `http://localhost:8080`

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f backend
   ```

   - Corrected environment variables
   - Fixed health check endpoint
   - Added proper multi-stage build targets

3. **`/workspace/Dockerfile`**
   - Created multi-stage build with backend/frontend targets
   - Fixed frontend asset copying (docs/ instead of dist/)
   - Maintained consistent port configuration

4. **`/workspace/SERVER_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Complete documentation of issues and fixes

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All identified issues have been resolved:
- ✅ `system_logs` table creation fixed
- ✅ Docker port configuration corrected  
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Health check endpoint working
- ✅ Database initialization successful
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker build configured

The Persian Legal AI Server should now start reliably without the previous SIGTERM restart cycles and database errors.
